<!-- What I learned in the first class:
The overall structure of HTML? -->

<!-- The main HTML tags include <html>, <body>, and <head>,
 each of which has specific functions in structuring web pages: -->

 <!-- 1. The <html> tag: This tag informs the browser that the content of the page
 is an HTML document. This tag should be placed at the beginning of each HTML page,
 and all the content of the page is placed between these tags. -->

     <html></html>

<!-- 2. The <head> tag: This tag is used to include information related to the page, 
such as the title, styles, scripts, and meta-data. The content inside this tag
 is not visible to users and is only accessible to the browser and search engines. -->

    <head></head>

<!-- 3. The <body> tag: This tag is used to include all the content that is visible to users
 on the web page. This includes text, images, links, tables, and other displayable elements. -->

    <body></body>

 <!-- For example, its general structure is as follows -->
 
<html>
    <head>
        <title>dya1/30</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>in the name of god</p>
    </body>
</html>


What are HTML tags?

<!-- HTML tags are elements used to define and structure the content of a website.
Tags are defined using angle brackets (<>) and are used for various purposes: -->

<!-- 1. The <p> tag: Used to define a paragraph of text.
    For example: -->
    <p>text</p>

<!-- 2. The <h1> to <h6> tags: Used to define different headings.
    For example: -->
    <h1>hello</h1>
    <h2>hello</h2>
    <h3>hello</h3>
    <h4>hello</h4>
    <h5>hello</h5>
    <h6>hello</h6>

<!-- 3. The <img> tag: Used to display images on a web page.
    For example -->
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="">

<!-- 4. The <br> tag: Used to create a new line on a web page.
 When this tag is placed in an HTML page, the following content moves to the next line.
     For example -->
    <p>
        Roses are red,<br>Violets are blue,<br>Sugar is sweet,<br>And so are you.
    </p>
